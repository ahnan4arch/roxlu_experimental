EasyCam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``EasyCam`` camera creates a Arcball so you can move around easily in your
scene. There are a couple of things you needs to call before you can use it.
You have to call ``EasyCam::setup(int screenWidth, int screenHeigth)`` once
and then translate the camera to a position from where you want to view the
scene. We use a camera, so you need to move along the positive Z is you want to
see something.

In your setup code:

.. code-block:: c++
		
	cam.setup(ofGetWidth(), ofGetHeight();
	cam.translate(0,0,10); // 10 units away from the thing we draw
	
	
Pass mouse events to the Camera

.. code-block:: c++
		
	void testApp::mouseDragged(int x, int y, int button){
		cam.onMouseDragged(x,y);
	}
	
	void testApp::mousePressed(int x, int y, int button){
		cam.onMouseDown(x,y);
	}

	
Place the camera in your draw function:

.. code-block:: c++

	void testApp::draw(){
		cam.place();
	}
